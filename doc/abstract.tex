\chapter{Abstract}
SAM Activities project consist of a set of activities that address the study and the therapeutics needs of people affected by Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDD).
The aim is to help the therapeutic process of the patients, by creating entertaining and relaxing activities that can improve the visual-motor coordination and space awareness of the patients. 
The activities are developed in a multi-sensory environment that includes equipment such as smart lights and kinect and the main controller is represented by the Smart Toy Dolphin Sam. \newline
The project comprises two kinds of activities, Dolphin Run and Dolphin Search. Dolphin Run is a multi-level obstacle game mode set in a marine environment, where the patient, interacting with Dolphin Sam, is moved around the virtual game area with the goal of avoiding all the obstacle that comes along his way, in order to reach the end of the level. Dolphin Search instead is a Search\&Find game mode where the patient has to find all the starfish hidden in the virtual game area.
Both the activities can be parameterized and personalized by the therapist based on the patient needs. The sessions results, sessions parameters and user profiles are accessible by the therapist through a web application.
