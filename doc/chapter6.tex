\chapter{Value Proposition}

Our solution ends up being really immersive, the integration of the Magic Room with Dolphin SAM provides an interaction equally balanced between the use of the object and the multi-sensory environment. 
For this reason the work can also be considered innovative and relatively new. 

Then, the information gathering through the related server, which is completely automated, helps the educator, to maintain clinical records about the patients, and trace eventual improvements across multiple sessions.

Extensibility comes also into place, particularly regarding the level structure of the activities. Also the information gathering mechanism can be easily extended by introducing other types of statistics. 

The portability of the application is then strictly related to the portability of the Magic Room. Although a local version of the game can still be played on any laptop, lacking in that case the classical immersivity provided by the room.
