	Abstract = {There is an ongoing interest in developing motion Kinect-based learning games that are in accordance with intervention protocols for helping children with special educational needs. These games, which offer natural user interaction modalities, seem to be very beneficial for this population because of the combination of physical activities with cognitive-training tasks. There is still an open research issue about how to integrate such games into schools and how to organize systematic evaluation studies for showing their added value. This paper presents the positive findings of a pilot research study in inclusive classroom settings that were carried out at two primary schools with 20 children who have special educational needs and who used the Kinems suite that contains movement-based educational games for such children. Analysis of data gathered via pre- and post-test questionnaires, interviews and an in-depth study of kinetic and learning analytics showed that these games have a positive impact on children's academic performance and improvement of their cognitive, motor and academic skills.},

@article{birchfield_embodiment_2008,
	Abstract = {We present concurrent theoretical work from HCI and Education that reveals a convergence of trends focused on the importance of three themes: embodiment, multimodality, and composition. We argue that there is great potential for truly transformative work that aligns HCI and Education research, and posit that there is an important opportunity to advance this effort through the full integration of the three themes into a theoretical and technological framework for learning. We present our own work in this regard, introducing the Situated Multimedia Arts Learning Lab (SMALLab). SMALLab is a mixed-reality environment where students collaborate and interact with sonic and visual media through full-body, 3D movements in an open physical space. SMALLab emphasizes human-to-human interaction within a multimodal, computational context. We present a recent case study that documents the development of a new SMALLab learning scenario, a collaborative student participation framework, a student-centered curriculum, and a three-day teaching experiment for seventy-two earth science students. Participating students demonstrated significant learning gains as a result of the treatment. We conclude that our theoretical and technological framework can be broadly applied in the realization of mixed reality, student-centered learning environments.},

@inproceedings{dalsgaard_between_2014,
	Abstract = {We present the notion of "bridging concepts" as a particular form of intermediary knowledge in HCI research, residing between theory and practice. We argue that bridging concepts address the challenge of facilitating exchange between theory and practice in HCI, and we compare it to other intermediary forms of knowledge such as strong concepts and conceptual constructs. We propose that bridging concepts have three defining constituents: a theoretical foundation, a set of design articulations and a range of exemplars that demonstrate the scope and potential of their application. These constituents specify how bridging concepts, as a form of knowledge, are accountable to both theory and practice. We present an analysis of the concept of "peepholes" as an example of a bridging concept aimed at spurring user curiosity and engagement.},

@inproceedings{ringland_sensorypaint:_2014,
	Abstract = {Multimodal and natural user interfaces offer an innovative approach to sensory integration therapies. We designed and developed SensoryPaint, a multimodal system that allows users to paint on a large display using physical objects, body-based interactions, and interactive audio. We evaluated the impact of SensoryPaint through two user studies: a lab-based study of 15 children with neurodevelopmental disorders in which they used the system for up to one hour, and a deployment study with four children with autism, during which the system was integrated into existing daily sensory therapy sessions. Our results demonstrate that a multimodal large display, using whole body interactions combined with tangible interactions and interactive audio feedback, balances children's attention between their own bodies and sensory stimuli, augments existing therapies, and promotes socialization. These results offer implications for the design of other ubicomp systems for children with neurodevelopmental disorders and for their integration into therapeutic interventions.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we describe Rope Revolution, a rope-based gaming system for collaborative play. After identifying popular rope games and activities around the world, we developed a generalized tangible rope interface that includes a compact motion-sensing and force-feedback module that can be used for a variety of rope-based games. Rope Revolution is designed to foster both co-located and remote collaborative experiences by using actual rope to connect players in physical activities across virtual spaces. Results from this study suggest that a tangible user interface with rich metaphors and physical feedback help enhance the gaming experience in addition to helping remote players feel connected across distances. We use this design as an example to motivate discussion on how to take advantage of the various physical affordances of common objects to build a generalized tangible interface for remote play.},

	Abstract = {Autism is a developmental disorder which presents disability in communication and socialisation and a lack of imagination. To promote creativity, exploration and enjoyment in low functioning autistic children that have no verbal communication, we propose MEDIATE, an interactive environment that generates real time visual, aural and vibrotactile stimuli. This paper focuses on the design of interaction with visuals within MEDIATE. The design is guided by the objectives of giving children a sense of agency and enhance non repetitive actions. Other guidelines of this design include natural interaction, use of non invasive technology and non representational visuals. This visual interaction (together with sound and vibrotacile) allows the children to enjoy MEDIATE and be creative within this environment.},

@article{garzotto_magic_2018,
	Abstract = {We exploit recent advances in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) technology to create the ``Magic Room'', a smart space created for use by children with Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD) and their caregivers. The Magic Room has been designed in cooperation with NDD specialists and supports multimodal embodied interaction by providing controllable stimuli to the vestibular, proprioceptive, and tactile sensory systems through various smart devices, e.g., ambient projections, physical objects, toys, ambient and mobile lights, aromas, and soap bubbles. We have deployed the Magic Room at two therapeutic centers. We performed exploratory studies with eight caregivers and nineteen children with severe impairments in the NDD spectrum, who used the smart room across four months with encouraging results. Our work may pave the ground for new research in the arena of CPSs for subjects with NDD and inspire new interventions for this target group.},

	Abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder is characterized by impaired social communication capacities which can prevent the formation of social relationships with peers. In recent years, potential programs for people with ASD have increasingly used Information and Communication Technologies mainly motivated by the affinity t h a t people with ASD show towards technology-supported tasks. We present the design of a full-body interaction experience called Lands of Fog, in which a child with ASD plays together with a typically developed child. The system is aimed towards fostering social interaction behaviors and collaboration. We have undertaken user trials with 34 ASD children through which Lands of Fog has proven to be a useful tool to foster social interaction. In this paper, we focus on the description of the interaction design process, methods and criteria that support the final experience. We then provide preliminary results from the user trials which provide a first hint of the efficacy of the system in fostering user's engagement and making socialization attitudes emerge.},
