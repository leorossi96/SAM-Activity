@inproceedings{ringland_sensorypaint:_2014,
	Abstract = {Multimodal and natural user interfaces offer an innovative approach to sensory integration therapies. We designed and developed SensoryPaint, a multimodal system that allows users to paint on a large display using physical objects, body-based interactions, and interactive audio. We evaluated the impact of SensoryPaint through two user studies: a lab-based study of 15 children with neurodevelopmental disorders in which they used the system for up to one hour, and a deployment study with four children with autism, during which the system was integrated into existing daily sensory therapy sessions. Our results demonstrate that a multimodal large display, using whole body interactions combined with tangible interactions and interactive audio feedback, balances children's attention between their own bodies and sensory stimuli, augments existing therapies, and promotes socialization. These results offer implications for the design of other ubicomp systems for children with neurodevelopmental disorders and for their integration into therapeutic interventions.},

@inproceedings{yao_rope_2011,
	Abstract = {In this paper we describe Rope Revolution, a rope-based gaming system for collaborative play. After identifying popular rope games and activities around the world, we developed a generalized tangible rope interface that includes a compact motion-sensing and force-feedback module that can be used for a variety of rope-based games. Rope Revolution is designed to foster both co-located and remote collaborative experiences by using actual rope to connect players in physical activities across virtual spaces. Results from this study suggest that a tangible user interface with rich metaphors and physical feedback help enhance the gaming experience in addition to helping remote players feel connected across distances. We use this design as an example to motivate discussion on how to take advantage of the various physical affordances of common objects to build a generalized tangible interface for remote play.},

@inproceedings{pares_promotion_2005,
	Abstract = {Autism is a developmental disorder which presents disability in communication and socialisation and a lack of imagination. To promote creativity, exploration and enjoyment in low functioning autistic children that have no verbal communication, we propose MEDIATE, an interactive environment that generates real time visual, aural and vibrotactile stimuli. This paper focuses on the design of interaction with visuals within MEDIATE. The design is guided by the objectives of giving children a sense of agency and enhance non repetitive actions. Other guidelines of this design include natural interaction, use of non invasive technology and non representational visuals. This visual interaction (together with sound and vibrotacile) allows the children to enjoy MEDIATE and be creative within this environment.},

@article{garzotto_magic_2018,
	Abstract = {We exploit recent advances in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) technology to create the ``Magic Room'', a smart space created for use by children with Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD) and their caregivers. The Magic Room has been designed in cooperation with NDD specialists and supports multimodal embodied interaction by providing controllable stimuli to the vestibular, proprioceptive, and tactile sensory systems through various smart devices, e.g., ambient projections, physical objects, toys, ambient and mobile lights, aromas, and soap bubbles. We have deployed the Magic Room at two therapeutic centers. We performed exploratory studies with eight caregivers and nineteen children with severe impairments in the NDD spectrum, who used the smart room across four months with encouraging results. Our work may pave the ground for new research in the arena of CPSs for subjects with NDD and inspire new interventions for this target group.},

@inproceedings{mora-guiard_lands_2016,
	Abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder is characterized by impaired social communication capacities which can prevent the formation of social relationships with peers. In recent years, potential programs for people with ASD have increasingly used Information and Communication Technologies mainly motivated by the affinity t h a t people with ASD show towards technology-supported tasks. We present the design of a full-body interaction experience called Lands of Fog, in which a child with ASD plays together with a typically developed child. The system is aimed towards fostering social interaction behaviors and collaboration. We have undertaken user trials with 34 ASD children through which Lands of Fog has proven to be a useful tool to foster social interaction. In this paper, we focus on the description of the interaction design process, methods and criteria that support the final experience. We then provide preliminary results from the user trials which provide a first hint of the efficacy of the system in fostering user's engagement and making socialization attitudes emerge.},
