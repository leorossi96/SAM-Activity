\chapter{Target Groups and User Needs}
\section{Main Target Groups}
As explained before in the introduction, our solution was designed and developed in order to be supportive in the treatment process of patients affected by NDD (Neurodevelopmental Disorder). In order to do so we identified different types of stakeholders and target groups with their respective needs that were taken into account:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Main targets
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$ - $] Therapists
		\item[$ - $] Patients
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
		\item Other entities affected
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[--] Families
		\item[--] Caregivers
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Context and Needs addressed}
	\subsection{Context}
	Our solution is designed to be used in centers specialized in the treatment of patients affected by NDD. In particular, given the centrality of the system-patient interaction and the key role that immersion plays in this aspect, the solution is designed to exploit the resources available in the Magic Room setup. The presence of a therapist in order to setup the activities, to monitor the patients and to analyze the information about their performances is also needed.
	
	\subsection{Needs addressed}
	During the design and development of \textit{SAM Activities} we took into account the following main need of the main targets for our solution:
	\begin{description}
		\item[\textbf{Patients}:] 
				\item{$ - $} Stay entertained and relaxed during the activities
				\item{$ - $} Being able to carry an activity autonomously
				\item{$ - $} Gain a better body  awareness (both coarse and fine grained)
				\item{$ - $} Avoid any kind of pressure
	\end{description}
	\begin{description}
		\item[\textbf{Therapists}:] 
			\item{$ - $} Monitor patients during activities
			\item{$ - $} Customize the activities based on the specific patients' conditions
			\item{$ - $} Being able to consult some analytic about the different patients sessions
	\end{description}
